Transit skim notes

4/7/16
error in reg_pprmw at transit settings (set_tnet) I also got it in pprmw_assign and pprmd_assign  on 2013 runs.  
Transit settings - cannot find resource trsp_mode83



Update drive skim matrix - 
	writing test.ctl file - starting around line 100
	switching // to \\ 
		i am sure manish did this on purpose, but I can't find a reason why, I have tried the ctl file both ways
	changing out complicated location statements (hopefully correctly)





reg_opbusw
around line 180 - "drop falg" - so what - just in list of matrices - but

Documentation update
started from 141202 - check if that is latest - only work in in transit skims
got basics drive approach section headings
need to add drop approach part - similar to drive, but with calls to KNR_... - 

DEBUG GUIDE
ADD debug guide to doc
local \report\tcreport has the batch routine report generated when tcb init is started and tcb closing is hit (error)
it is the best place to find where things went wrong
Rule is to put init only in the jobs called by runjob - subroutine should not have an init - when counting - have to backtrack INCLUDING subs

adding clear for hwyskim and drop flag
