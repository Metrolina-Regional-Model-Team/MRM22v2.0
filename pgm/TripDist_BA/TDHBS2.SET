  Input:
    ffactors  = F factors
    prods     = productions (ASCII)
    attrs     = attractions (ASCII)
    htime     = highway time matrix
    ttime     = transit time matrix
    htoll     = highway toll matrix (optional)
  Output:
    trips     = output ASCII trip table
    list      = program reports

Parameters:
  print_te   = print trip ends? (t/f, default t)
  print_tlf  = print trip lth. freq. distribution? (t/f, def. t)
  skimmax    = max. impedance value for highway time (90)
  iter       = number of gravity model iterations requested (4)
  ttimefac   = sensitivity factor for transit time (1.0)
  htollfac   = sensitivity factor for highway toll (0.0)
  tformat    = trip end format specifier (no default)
        (this must identify 2 Integer fields and one Real field:
        TAZ, sequential zone number, trip ends [productions or attractions])
  sformat    = skim format specifier (no default)
        (this must identify 2 Integer fields and one Real field:
        origin TAZ, destination TAZ, skim value; the Real field MUST be f?.0)
  tlf_file   = output TLF file? (t/f, def. f)
  	(automatically named like the LIST file, with extension .DAT)
